# Current-Weather-Forecasting-Website

The Website uses Open Weather Api to fetch data.  
The Website takes in city name and returns its current Weather and its temperature.  
The Website also displays the current date.  
  
There is also a manifest.json file which can be used to make a chrome extension.  
  
To make a chrome extension you need to do the following:  
1) Go to your chrome browser and go to manage extensions.  
2) Turn on Developer mode and you will see an option saying load unpacked.
3) Click on it and load the entire folder containing all the files.
